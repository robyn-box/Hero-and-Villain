# Superhero vs Villain 

This is a CRUD practice for the end user's experience. By designing your own Villain or Superhero, including the powers they possess. The end user will add or remove or delete superpowers or even scrap the initial character and start over again from scratch.

## Process Description

* You will first design your own Villain or Superhero by first getting the image in one of two ways; find the hero character from the internet or simply choose to use an existing hero on the websites gallery/start page.
* Once the hero character is decided, choose what powers your hero will possess. If choosing an existing hero, the hero must belong to you, then you may add/remove/delete hero or attached powers.
* In the end you will have a hero that is created to your liking and will reside in the gallery page for others to see.
